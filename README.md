# Database-Project
Create a website with forms and store the responses in a database

# Project Summary
In my database class in college, we developed a website with forms on it
for a woman who runs a non-profit organization for refugees. She supplies shoes, clothing,
and baby products to impoverished families. She needed a database to store the information
about the refugees like: their name, address, children's names, ages, and shoe sizes. Also,
the refugees needed a site to fill out the forms and have options to select their primary language.
The database we developed had parent and children tables where they were related through a foreign key, which was
the parent's id. The goal was to make it so that the owner could search for the parents and see all of the
information about his or her children. For the website itself, the full stack we used was React JS as our frontend 
framework, Axios to send information from the forms to the backend, Express Node JS as our backend framework,
and the Express app object to query the database.
